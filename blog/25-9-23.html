        <h2>Blog Post 9/23/25</h2>
        <p>
          welp. this is the first blog post.
          <br><br>
          I'm still working on the site, trying to figure out how to make a blog on a static website like this. Right now if I wanted to update how blog posts look I'd need to change an html file for every single blog post. That's not too bad if you only have a couple but at one post a month it would only take a few years for that to become a huge pain in the ass. I guess I could solve that problem with some creative javascript, my last website effectively functioned like that, but there's some downsides to that aproach. Right now my solution is to just keep the blog posts as simple as possible, no navbar, just text and css and simple next, prev, and back buttons so there's nothing to update. Honestly I'm considering writing some jank script where the blog posts are stored in some other format and then compiled into html documents before uploading to the server. basically what php can do but pre-baked. I can't be bothered though. This site is enough work as it is.
          <br><br>
          As of now there is no way for anyone to be notified of a new blog post being published but I don't mind. I think part of the fun is forgetting that this exists and then reading years of backloged posts. I will probably post about it on socmed though lol.
          <br><br>
          Speaking of socmed. I've been away from there since the 3rd taking another media break. Basically I'm going without social media, youtube, videogames, tv, and movies for the entire month (all rules are void when I'm socializing though). It's been nice so far, very boring. I try to do this excercise every year or so and it really helps me although I struggle to justify it to people. It's like a vacation. A vacation where you're stuck in a cabin in the woods with no internet and have nothing to do other than read books (and write websites apparantly??). Some people get it, some people don't. It helps me to remember what boredom feels like which is something of a rarity these days. I think never having time to be bored may be driving people a little mad...
          <br><br>
          So far this month I've read <i>The Gods Themselves</i> by Isaac Asimov, <i>Neuromancer</i> by William Gibson and I am currently working my way through its sequal <i>Count Zero</i>. All three have been amazing books, you should read them. Well maybe not The Gods Themselves unless you like weird 70's scifi (like I do). That book strangly has a lot to say about gender, with the alien species in the novel having 3 distinct genders and the main character being effectively nonbinary (nontrinary??). A lot of time is spent describing how these aliens have sex, seemingly more than is spent on describing anything else about their world. The main character has sex with rocks and that's important to the plot. Truly amazing literature. Sadly the book kind of just ends, with the human main characters solving the problem that had the entire human race in jeaprody with very little difficulty. it felt rushed. Facinating, but lacking a compelling conclusion. I don't have anything to say about Neuromancer however. It's a good read.

          I'm planning on going to PRGE this year with a friend of mine. Really looking forward to exploring Portland and getting to spend time with him. fuckin expensive though...

          <p>
          I got my robot vaccuum working, an iRobot roomba model 595 "pet series" probably from 2009-ish. I bought it at a thrift store with some parts for $15 years ago. it just needed a new battery so I didn't think it desereve its own project page.
          <br><br>
          I'm not sure how useful it will be. This is the first robot vaccuum I've ever used. The fairytale is that it will save time and keep your house cleaner because you can have it run automatically but it takes 30 minutes to do maybe 5-10 minutes of human work and it's so damn loud. I will admit that as someone with ADHD watching a silly little robot guy crash into your furnature over and over sure beats sweeping, even if I spend more time watching the damn thing than it would've taken to do it myself. I'd say on a logical level it's completely rediculous but if it makes my stupid ADHD brain excited about cleaning, then that's a huge win lol
          <br><br>
          Anyways that's it for september. I'm starting school soon so I don't know how much time (or energy) I'll have for keeping up with the site so hopefully this wont be the only blog post lol. take care assholes &lt;3
